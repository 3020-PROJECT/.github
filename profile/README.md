# 3020-Project

> **Note:** This is an example setup ‚Äî you don‚Äôt actually need a TL-MR3020 to explore the projects. Feel free to adapt the code to any hardware you already have! üòÑ


The **3020-Project** is an open-source initiative dedicated to unlocking the potential of the **TL-MR3020 router**. Through a series of experiments and projects, we transform this small, affordable device into a flexible mini-computer that can interface with Arduino Nanos, ESP32 displays, and keyboards ‚Äî proving that curiosity and creativity can breathe new life into old hardware.

## Projects

### üîå 3020-NANO
A lightweight **Arduino Nano firmware** that listens for **serial commands** from the TL-MR3020.  
Allows remote execution of I/O operations such as reading/writing digital or analog pins and controlling an LCD display.  

**Features:**
- Serial command protocol for Nano control  
- Digital & analog I/O support (`read`, `write`, `aread`, `awrite`, `pinmode`)  
- LCD support via I¬≤C  
- Human-readable responses (`OK`, `KO`)

### ‚å®Ô∏è 3020-Keyboard
A **keyboard bridge program** that forwards keypresses to both the Arduino Nano and an **ESP-VGA-Displayer** over TCP/IP.  
Enables live text input on the VGA screen while simultaneously controlling the Nano.

**Features:**
- Dual output: serial + network  
- Live text mirroring on VGA  
- Modular, simple design for integration with other hardware

### üñ•Ô∏è ESP-VGA-Displayer
An **ESP32 project** that drives a VGA display using a simple TCP/IP text protocol.  
Other devices on the same network can send text commands in real time, turning the ESP32 into a versatile display server.

**Features:**
- VGA output powered directly by the ESP32  
- TCP-based text protocol  
- Color control and live updates
